<h1>Taylor Swift's Albums Ranked from Worst to Best</h1>
<p>This will be a subjective list of Taylor Swift's ten main albums, ranked according to my thoughts on them. To avoid getting into the weeds, I won't be including the "Taylor's Version" albums or any of the miscellaneous, deluxe, etc. albums in my review.</p>

<h2>10. Lover (2019)</h2>
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder image">
<p>This isn’t a surprise to most Swifties - Lover is widely regarded as one of Swift’s least punchy albums. It’s fun and bubblegum pop-esque, but is lacking in memorability, save for a few tracks like “Cruel Summer”, “Death by a Thousand Cuts,” and of course, its title track “Lover”.</p>
<h2>9. Taylor Swift (2006)</h2>
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder image">
<p>Taylor’s debut self-titled album, released when she was just 16 years old, is full of twang and country realness. Some undisputed classics came from this album - karaoke favorite “Our Song”, “Teardrops On My Guitar”, and “Should’ve Said No” being a few. But at this early stage of her career, Taylor had yet to grow into her voice and style that she’s known for today, making this album lower on the list.</p>
<h2>8. Reputation (2017)</h2>
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder image">
<p>In “Reputation”, Swift attempts to take back the narrative surrounding her life in the public eye, while of course still delivering us a few of the sing-along-worthy love ballads she’s known for. But the aesthetic of darkness and revenge throughout the album doesn’t feel true to Swift, and gives the air of someone trying to be something they’re not.</p>
<h2>7. Midnights (2022)</h2>
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder image">
<p>Swift said that the tracks on her latest release, “Midnights”, were written throughout years of “sleepless nights”, and that’s not hard to envision when listening. This album has a modern and eclectic vibe to it, perhaps comparable to “1989”, which came several years earlier. Lyrically, it’s not Swift at her best, but the tracks are mostly catchy and designed to be earworms.</p>
<h2>6. 1989 (2014)</h2>
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder image">
<p>Taylor’s first foray into creating a fully-pop album after a career as a primarily country singer is inventive and bold - much of it takes inspiration from the style of ‘80s music, but doesn’t try too hard to convince the listener that it’s an homage to the time period. It’s upbeat and crooney, a songwriting style that Swift does well.</p>
<h2>5. Speak Now (2010)</h2>
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder image">
<p>Swift is really beginning to grow into her lyricism in this album - it features the powerful, belty ballads “Back to December'', “Last Kiss”, and “Dear John,” as well as some rock-country tracks that have stood the test of time. It’s got that undeniable heartfelt Taylor vibe.
</p>
<h2>4. Fearless (2008)</h2>
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder image">
<p>This album is a tribute to the highs and lows of young love. If you ask the average person what songs come to mind when they think of Taylor Swift, they’re bound to mention “You Belong With Me” and “Love Story”, both products of this album. Nearly every song on “Fearless” poetically addresses the intense emotions that come with first crushes and first heartbreaks.</p>
<h2>3. Red (2012)</h2>
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder image">
<p>“Red” is by far one of Taylor Swift’s most memorable albums because it cemented her successful shift away from country music. It features some of the most iconic pop songs of the 2010s, including “22” and “I Knew You Were Trouble.” Then, of course, there’s “All Too Well” - a ballad regarded by many as one of Swift’s very best songs - if not the best song - she’s ever written because of the masterful web-weaving and imagery in the lyrics. The release of “Red (Taylor’s Version)” in 2021 featured the original 10-minute-long version of the song and a short film directed by Swift to go along with it, cementing it as one of her powerhouse tracks.</p>
<h2>2. Evermore (2020)</h2>
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder image">
<p>Evermore is an album that manages to be both relaxed and intense in nature at the same time. There’s no theatrical production or big vocal belts on this one - but the more soft-spoken, acoustic style showcased throughout Evermore suits Swift downright beautifully. There’s incredible emphasis on the lyricism, storytelling, and world-building in this album - plus a fun country murder song, “no body no crime (featuring HAIM)”, that takes the listener back to Taylor’s earlier roots.</p>
<h2>1. Folklore (2020)</h2>
<img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder image">
<p>Folklore, the album that preceded Evermore, showed a side of Taylor Swift that the world had never seen before. Produced during the COVID-19 pandemic, Folklore is undoubtedly the best lyricism of Swift’s entire career - dreamy, warm vocals take the listener through a myriad of storylines and fairytale-esque songs about life, loss, and the complexities of what we imagine love to be vs. what it actually is. Folklore’s genre could be considered much more “indie” than Swift’s earlier works - but it feels like the most honest, unabridged version of Taylor Swift that we’ve ever had.</p>
