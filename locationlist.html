<h1>Top Ten Coffee Shops in Brussels, Belgium</h1>
<p>Summer of 2022 landed me in Brussels, Belgium, where I lived for nearly three months as part of the Missouri School of Journalism’s internship study abroad program. Here is my Top 10 ranking of Brussels coffee shops, from an avid caffeine lover.</p>
<h2>10. Leopold Cafe Pressé</h2>
<a href="https://leopoldcafepresse.com/">Website</a>
<p>This place is home to some solid bagel options and has an eclectic vibe. However, I was a bit underwhelmed by the beverages - an iced chai latte and a regular iced latte - that I’ve ordered from this café.</p>
<h2>9. Café Belga</h2>
<p>Pl. Eugene Flagey 18, 1050 Ixelles, Belgium
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/cafebelga/?hl=en">Instagram</a>
<a href="tel+3226403508">+32 2 640 35 08</a>
One of the best places to go for relaxed vibes and a sunny indoor/outdoor seating area. The iced latte with oat milk that I had from here was perfectly enjoyable. Plus, it’s also a bar - they have beers/cocktails, and various Belgian snack foods such as the famous “croque monsieur”.</p>
<h2>8. Fika</h2>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fikabrussels/">Facebook</a>
<a href="tel+3225028885">+32 2 502 88 85</a>
<p>Rue de la Paix 17, 1050 Ixelles, Belgium
A cute little shop with really yummy cinnamon buns, but their drink menu is slightly limited. My go-to iced latte was solid and it came in a nice big glass. This is a no-frills kind of coffee place.</p>
<h2>7. Buddy Buddy</h2>
<a href="https://www.buddybuddy.bio/">Website</a>
<p>Rue des Drapiers 10, 1050 Brussels, Belgium
This place’s concept is cute - it’s very bright and welcoming. Almost all of their menu items are made with their various homemade nut butters. The cinnamon roll and iced chai latte from here were both rich and flavorful but VERY sweet - definitely not an everyday kind of coffee joint, but fun for a treat!</p>
<h2>6. Café du Sablon</h2>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/cafedusablonbxl/?hl=en">Instagram</a>
<a href="tel+3225033999">+ 32 2 503 39 99</a>
<p>Rue de la Régence 26, 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium
Lovely bright café with a solid food menu. My hot latte from here was tasty and not too bitter even without any sort of sweetener.</p>
<h2>5. Coffee Lacrosse</h2>
<a href="https://www.coffeelacrosse.com/menu">Website</a>
<p>Bld. General Jacques 124, 1050 Ixelles, Belgium
It can be hard to find sweet coffee in Brussels when you’re in the mood for it - the Belgians like their traditional coffee and no-nonsense espresso. Therefore, I was so pleased that I was able to get a delicious hazelnut latte from Coffee Lacrosse! I ate brunch here too - their banana bread and club sandwich hit the spot.</p>
<h2>4. Karsmakers Coffee House</h2>
<a href="https://www.karsmakers.be/">Website</a>
<p>Rue de Trèves 20, 1050 Ixelles, Belgium
This was my go-to coffee shop for a lot of my time in Brussels! The best bagel that I was able to find in Brussels, a big drink menu, super friendly staff (that all spoke great English, which made life a little easier for me considering my poor French skills!), and a beautiful garden to sit in. Plus, it was near the European Parliament, the heart of the action in Brussels. </p>
<h2>3. Cup 28</h2>
<a href="https://facebook.com/Cup28.bx/">Facebook</a>
<p>Rue due Bailli 34, 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium
The food, the caramel latte, and the vibes here were amazing. An aboslutely stacked breakfast menu - the best meal of the day.</p>
<h2>2. Gruun</h2>
<a href="https://www.gruun.brussels/">Website</a>
<p>Pl. de la Vieille Hall aux Blés 36, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
An ADORABLE shop. Gruun sells household plants as well as drinks, so lots of bright colors and greenery in this place. One of the best chai lattes I had in Brussels - I wish I’d found it sooner into my study abroad experience.</p>
<h2>1. Belga & Co.</h2>
<a href="tel+3226441498">+32 2 644 14 98</a>
<a href="https://www.belgacoffee.com/">Website</a>
<p>Rue du Bailli 7A, 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium
I have a soft spot for Belga & Co. for sure - it was near my apartment in Brussels so I went there often to do work, drink an iced latte and eat a blueberry cheesecake slice. The staff is very friendly and it’s just a pleasant place to be - I miss it.</p>
