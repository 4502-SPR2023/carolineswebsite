<h1>My Senior Mizzou Homecoming in Photos</h1>
<p>A few images that showcase how 2022 Mizzou Homecoming - my final Mizzou homecoming as a student - set itself apart from previous years.</p>
<img src="IMG_5051.jpg" alt="house decs">
<p>This photo is part of the decorations that my sorority, Alpha Chi Omega, built in front of our house for the festivities. Every Greek house is assigned a theme to base our decor on, and our theme this year was the Peanuts cartoon characters.</p>
<img src="IMG_5056.jpg" alt="truman">
<p>This is a photo of Truman riding on a side-by-side through Greektown. Every year on Homecoming, Greektown fills up with students, families, and alumni that come to view various themed house decorations. There are also typically games and food trucks in the streets.</p>
<img src="IMG_5076.jpg" alt="marching mizzou">
<p>This is a photo I took while at the Homecoming parade as Marching Mizzou passed by my viewing spot near Memorial Union.</p>
<img src="IMG_5417.jpg" alt="faurot field">
<p>This photo is from the first few minutes of the Homecoming football game. In the photo, Truman is getting ready to greet the student section of Faurot Field.</p>
<img src="IMG_5444.jpg" alt="megan">
<p>This is a photo I took of my friend Megan after she won Mizzou Homecoming Queen. Winning Mizzou Homecoming Royalty is the highest honor that a senior at Mizzou can receive and is a huge deal!</p>
